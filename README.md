UsernameMiner
=============
This is a collection of programs each intended for a differerent purpose.
These are:
1. WebCrawler.py - To crawl a website for its pages
2. NameExtractor.py - To extract names from a webpage
3. UserListGen.py - To mutate a list of names into common username conventions
4. Bruteforcer.py - To create an adaptable platform for dual field bruteforcing

These all come together to be a data mining and password attack project designed
to help me with my work.
